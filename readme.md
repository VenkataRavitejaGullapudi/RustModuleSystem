# Rust Module System

- Rust has a number of features that allow us to manage our codeâ€™s organization, includes about which details are exposed, which details are private, and what names are in each scope in your programs.
- These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the module system.
- The Rust module system includes:
  - **_Packages_**: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates.
  - **_Crates_**: Each crate can be a tree of modules that produces a library or executable.
  - **_Modules and use_**: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths.
  - **_Paths_**: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module.


## Crates
- The smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time is a Crate.
- Rust compiler considers each file as Crate.
- A crate can be of 2 forms
    1. Binary crate
    2. Library crate

### Binary crate
- Binary crates are the programs that can be compiled to an executable which we can run. This can be command line program or a server.
- Each binary crate should have a main function that specifies what need to be done when it the executable runs.
- Cargo follows a convention that src/main.rs is the crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the package.

### Library crate
- Library crates doesnot have a main function, they cannot be compiled to an executable.
- These define the functionality that can be shared across multiple projects.
- For example, `rand` crate provides the functionality that generates random numbers. Most of the time when the rust programmers say crates, it is a library crate* and they interchangeably call as library.
- The crate root is the source file that Rust compiler starts from.
- Cargo follows a convention that src/lib.rs is the crate root of a library crate with the same name as the package.
- Cargo passes the crate root files to rustc to build the library or binary.

## Packages
- A package can contain one or more crates that provide certain functionality.
- A package can be generated by using `cargo new package_name`.
- Each package contains a `Cargo.toml` file which contains the package name, dependencies, crates and other info about the package and this descibes how to build those crates.
- A package can contain as many binary crates as you like, but only one library crate.
- A package must contain atleast one library crate or one binary crate.
- A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the src/bin directory where each file will be a separate binary crate.
